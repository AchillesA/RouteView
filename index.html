        <h2>RouteView - Driving or Riding Simulation (Virtual drive/ride using StreetView)</h2>

        I ride a motorcycle, and to prepare my next Saturday ride, I often use GoogleMaps and StreetView to figure out how cool the road is.<br>
        Is it a two lanes or a four lanes road? Is it curvy? How nice is the scenery? etc.
        So basically, I create a route, and then move the StreeView icon along some random points on the route to look at the road.<br>
        I found this manual process kind of tedious. <br>
        I thought that using StreetView to allow a kind of 'Virtual Drive' would be easier and more fun... <br>
        So I use Google Maps v3, some existent code floating around to do this, and wrote the javascript code in an html page.<br>
        I hope thia might be usefull to other people. <br>
        <br>

        The web page allows you to create a route using Google Maps, and then do a 'virtual travel' through this route using Google Street View.
        <br>
        <ul>
        <li>Create an origin point (for instance: Raleigh, NC)</li>
        <li>Create a destination point (for instance: Troy, NC)</li>
        <li>Create optionally a waypoint (for instance: Asheboro, NC)</li>
        <li>Then click the Start button to see all Street View image along the route!</li>
        </ul>
      
        The default step is 250 meters, and the default interval beteen two stepa is 750 millisecons.<br>
        These values can be changed interactively using a slider.<br>
        <br>

        Code is created with Google Maps API v3, and use the <a href="http://econym.org.uk/gmap/epoly.htm">EPolys extension:</a><br>
        <br>
        
        I choose to keep the code as simple as possible, and also to use a single html file, so the interface is not sophisticated by design, 
        using only HTML5 controls (no jquery or dojo...).

        <br>
        <br>
        
        <button style="font-size:24px" id="id_btn_expand_collapse" type="button" onclick="cb_expand_collapse()">
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://rawgit.com/osingla/RouteView/master/RouteView.html" target="_blank">Click here to start playing with it!</a>  &nbsp;&nbsp;
            <br>
            <br>
        </button>
        
        <br>
        <br>
        Notes:<br>
        <ul>
        <li>early prototype</li>
        <li>tested only with Chrome at this point, but this seems to work fine with Firefox</li>
        <li>start/stop kind of works, but for now hit refresh if you change the route</li>
        </ul>
